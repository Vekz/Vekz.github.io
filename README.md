## Theming and visuals
For this project theme I used Nord Color Pallete. 
I decided on it as it is main theme for my private desktop and any app that supports it on it. 

I chose dark background of Polar Night shades, mostly:
#3B4252 and #4C566A.

For accents I turned to Snow Storm shades of off-whites, and chose warm gray of #ECEFF4. Also for some more vibrant colors i decided on Frost shade of #88C0D0, and Aurora's #EBCB8B
