## Description
This repositorium holds code and github page for my own portfolio and show-off site. I intend on using it for project descriptions, shader showoffs and any other thing that I want to share with the internet.

## Technologies used:
- react
- typescript
- styled-components
- react-icons
- react-router
- gh-pages

## Theming and visuals
For this project theme I used Nord Color Pallete.

I decided on it as it is main theme for my private desktop and any app that supports it.
